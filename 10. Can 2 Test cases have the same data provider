Can 2 Test cases have the same data provider. Example: Testcases.class,

Yes. we can have. Let's discuss an example of this. Let's create a Testcases.class

Inside the Testcases i will create two test cases 

ackage test;

public class Testcases {
	
	@Test(priority=1)
	public void testA(){
		
	}
	
	@Test(priority=2)
	public void testB(){
		
	}
}

Suppose if both of these test cases want the same set of data.

Let's create a data provider in Data_Provider.class.

	@DataProvider(name="testDataProvider")
	public static Object[][] getsampledata(){
		Object[][] data = new Object[2][2];

		data[0][0]="U5";
		data[0][1]="P5";

		data[1][0]="U6";
		data[1][1]="P6";

		return data;

	}
	
I can refer this data provider name "testDataProvider" in both the test cases.
Example: 

import org.testng.annotations.Test;

public class Testcases {
	
	@Test(priority=1,dataProviderClass=Data_Provider.class,dataProvider="testDataProvider")
	public void testA(){
		
	}
	
	@Test(priority=2,dataProviderClass=Data_Provider.class,dataProvider="testDataProvider")
	public void testB(){
		
	}
}

For both these tests, data will be sent 2 times. Below data

		data[0][0]="U5";
		data[0][1]="P5";

		data[1][0]="U6";
		data[1][1]="P6";
		
Multiple tests can have the same data provider. We are assuming a scenario that there are multiple tests 
which wants the same data and they have the same data provider.

After execution you will see testA and testB will execute 2 times with the same set of data.

** There is another scenario were multiple tests but with different data and same data provider.
Can this possible?

For example, let's take our RegTest.class which is having "regTestDataProvider" data provider and take 
Sample.class in which we are having "loginTestDataProvider" data provider but can these both tests have same
data provider.

Yes, they can have.

Go to your data provider and there You will have to pass over a parameter with overloaded version of it. 
	
	@DataProvider(name="testDataProvider")
	public static Object[][] getsampledata(Method m){
	
With the Method m when this data provider "testDataProvider" is called automatically TestNG passes the 
name of the method to Method m and if the name of the method testA match with the if condition 
then it will execute with it's test data else if the name of the test case is testB then it will execute 
with it's test data.

So multiple test cases can have same data provider whether they want with the same set of data whether 
they want with different set of data.
