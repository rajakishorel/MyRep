Up to now we have executed each of the class individually. Ex: YahooMailTest.java

Now, we'll execute both the tests in a batch. Ex: YahooMailTest.java + YahooNewsTest.java

This can be done using a file known as "testng.xml". This file has some configuration which will tell testng
and eclipse that these are the following testcases which have to be run together.

To manually create testng.xml file:

1. Go to http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html
2. Copy the xml content from example testng.xml file
3. Create a new file in source and name it as testng.xml
4. Paste the copied xml content inside the newly created testng.xml file.
5. Now modify as per your test classes.

Example:
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "http://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd" >
  
<suite name="Yahoo" verbose="1" >

  <test name="Yahoo Mail Test" >
    <classes>
       <class name="test.YahooMailTest" />
    </classes>
  </test>
 
  <test name="Yahoo News Test">
    <classes>
       <class name="test.YahooNewsTest"/>
    </classes>
  </test>
  
</suite>

*test name="" can be anything that's not a problem but in <class name=""/> the package and class name 
must be same that are inside the project.

* The execution order in testng.xml will start from top to bottom.

* To execute:
1. Right click on testng.xml file
2. Select the option "Run As" -> TestNG Suite.

It will be executed in a batch with execution order from top to bottom.
