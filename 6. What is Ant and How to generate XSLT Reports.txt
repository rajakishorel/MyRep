Ant is something which can help you to run your programs on linux based servers and systems or it can also help 
you to run your program on command prompt.

Suppose i want run whole suite through command prompt. Till now we have ran our programs through eclipse.

Using ant we can run our programs through command prompt. ANT is a build and compile tool.

Download the zip file from http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

Extract it and point the folder by creating a environment variable called ANT_HOME = "Folder path".
Now point the bin path inside ANT Folder in path variable.

Run the command ant in command prompt. It will give you an error message
copy tools.jar file from jdk\lib folder and paste it in to jre\lib folder.

Now still you will get the following error messages.
Buildfile: build.xml does not exist!
Build failed

ANT always looks for a file called Build.xml when it is running the program. If you want to run your project through
ANT or through command prompt then you need to use Build.xml file.

If we want to generate a detailed TestNG report then we have to run through the ANT. These kind of reports can be 
generated through eclipse.

**Build.xml file is like a heart of ANT. Make sure your Build.xml should be under the project only.

Change the following places in Build.xml file.

1st place:
<!-- ========== Initialize Properties =================================== -->
    <property environment="env"/>
    
    <property name="ws.home" value="${basedir}"/>
	<property name="ws.jars" value="D:\Selenium Jars"/> // value should be the location of your jar files.
	
2nd place:
<!-- compile -->
<javac 
            debug="true" 
            destdir="${test.dest}" 
            srcdir="${test.src}" 
            target="1.8" // you have to modified the target to your jdk version.
            
3rd place:
you have to provide the xsl sheet in to the follow location.
"src/xslt/testng-results.xsl"

Once the above configurations are done then we are good to go.

Now in command prompt run
1. ant compile 			// which compiles your project
2. ant run 				// which runs your project
3. ant makexsltreports	// which generates xslt reports in "XSLT_Reports" folder inside your project.
4. ant clean			// you can clean your build folder in your project which gets created when you compile your project.

Now open index.html file inside XSLT_Reports -> output folder.

If you open the file index.hmtl file you will now get to see the detailed XSLT Report.
